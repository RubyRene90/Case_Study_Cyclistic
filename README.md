This is a case study on coursera for a fictional company called Cyclistic Bike-Share. The data used is from a real company located in Chicago, IL. I am comparing 2 types of bike riders, those with annual memberships and those that ride casually. I have completed the case study and my portfolio includes:

-SQL Queries (in order from start to finish),
  1_understanding_dataset,
  2_annual_trip_data_cleaning,
  3_annual_tripadata_analyzing,
  4_annual_tripdata_analyzing2,
  and 5_annual_tripdata_analyzin3
