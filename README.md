This is a case study on coursera for a fictional company called Cyclistic Bike-Share. The data used is from a real company located in Chicago, IL. I am comparing 2 types of bike riders, those with annual memberships and those that ride casually. I have completed the case study and my portfolio includes:

----SQL Queries (in order from start to finish, listed with files that begin with number)
     BIG QUERY was used to analyze data

----Documentation for Case Study PDF

----Cyclistic Analyzed Data (link in file to google.sheet)

----The Cyclistic analysis report PDF
     The report includes links to everything as well.
